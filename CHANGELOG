--Fixed the small problem of the text fields not liking 0s. (Whoops!)
  Never put the the getch sequence as the test for the while loop. :-P
--Fixed the cursor location bug, as well as the paging bug.
--Expanded support for all printable characters on the PC keyboard in
  text fields.
--Fixed the cursor/line bug when the cursor position is on the last line,
  and on a new line character in the text field widget.
--Added Up/Down arrows to indicate existing content out of view in the
  window in the text field widget.
--Added Up/Down arrow, Page Up, Page Down support to the text field widget.
--Moved the $colour scalar into the BEGIN tag clause, so the has_colors()
  function need only be called once.

  function itself, dependent upon the persistent $colour.
--select_colours now returns a 1 if it could successfully set the colour,
  as per $colour, and a 0 if not.
--init_colours() *must* be called now, since this is the routine that sets
  the value of $colour, and the colour pairs.
--Each widget now draws its border with A_BOLD if the $colour is not
  available and 'draw_only' was not set.
--Added Up/Down arrows to indicate list entries that exist out of view of

  exiting the routine.
