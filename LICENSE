Corliss Licensing Terms ;-)
==========================

(c) 1998, Arthur Corliss

I freely acknowledge here the incredible debt I owe to the many programmers
who preceded me, and granted me the benefit of their knowledge and skill for
free.  In honour of that, and in order to make my contribution, I hereby offer
these licensing terms:

	1)  Feel free to mutilate, enhance, and otherwise modify any of the
	    code provided herein.  I only ask that I be given access to any
	    and all changes to the code, so that I can learn from and integrate
	    any such additions to an improved, free product.
	2)  Any derived works give me at least an honourary footnote for
	    providing the original work.
	3)  Provided that the above two conditions are met, everyone is free
	    to use and distribute this software to the full extent of their
	    ability.  Whether or not you can get someone to charge for this
	    tripe is your problem, but if you can do it, more power to you.
	4)  As with any software package, if this manages to destroy your home
	    life, your work life, make your hair fall out (a definite possibility,
		if my own hairline is any indication), or otherwise cause some
		negative affect--guess what--it's not my problem.  Use at your
		own risk.  ;-)

That pretty much wraps up the extent of my licensing.  Try not to abuse it too
much by driving trucks through the gaping legal holes in it, okay?  :-)
