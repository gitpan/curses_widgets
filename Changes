	--calendar:  provides a navigable calendar
	--buttons:  provides a vertical or horizontal button set
	--init_colours:  initialises the colour portion of Curses,

	--select_colour:  sets the colour mode for the appropriate
	  window, by name

--Fixed some of the bugs in the text field widget, but I still have
  some work to do on the paging portion.
--Text field now directly supports teh backspace, home/end, and right/
  left keys, as well as normal text.

--All widgets now handle their own special keys
--Text widget now handles modification to content as well, returning the
  the updated content to the calling routine.
--cal output now stored in a persistent array, so it only needs to be
  called when moving to a new month, now.
--None of the widgets need to have window declared for them, now.  All
  of them will create their own derived windows, and destroy them upon
  exiting the routine.
--Replaced all chr calls in box commands with the ACS_* constants, for
  more reliable rendering on various term types.
--New select_colour function for selecting character colour by name.  Only
  supports red, blue, green, and yellow, currently.
--More comments, and a few misc. tweaks.

Optimised the code a bit with better if/elsif structures, as well
as making the colour coding consistent among the widgets and
optimising the variable declarations.
